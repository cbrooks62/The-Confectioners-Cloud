# Demo
### This app was built for my full stack capstone for C9 [New Force](https://generationwv.org/programs/newforce/)
### You can watch my recorded demo ->>[here](https://www.loom.com/share/611d8b17547d4af7b4591597e8119786).
# Install
1. Clone this repository.
1. `cd` into the directory it creates.
1. Run `start Capstone.sln`. This will open the files relevant to your database in Visual Studio 2022 (the purple one).
1. Run the files inside of the SQL folder labeled `SQL-Capstone-DB.sql` and `SQL-SEED-DB.sql`.
1. In your terminal, cd into the subdirectory labeled `client`.
1. Run `ls` to ensure you are on the same level as the `package-lock.json` file.
1. Run `npm run dev` and then open the localhost link in your browser.
1. In Visual Studio 2022 (the purple one), click the solid green `Run` arrow in the top middle of your screen. This will pull up `swagger` in a new window. Leave this open and return to the localhost for React.
